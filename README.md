# sqc
At the beginning, I wanted to use python to develop a tool for ddl conversion between different databases. 
Halfway through the development, I found that python did not have as rich support for different data drivers as jdbc, such as DatabaseMetadata. 
I didnâ€™t want to waste code, so I wrote a simple tool to execute SQL



attention:
when i push File Lib/site-packages/oraociei11.dll,it is 135.63 MB; this exceeds GitHub's limit 100M.
so i delete it
